not just frontend and backend but conceptual system design to full self hosted deployment of every single one of my projects

I am unafraid to get into the nitty gritty and optimize down the the very bits used and how their shape affects cache and so on.

I take an engineering approach to automation, not acceptingthe fault tolerances in modern LLM based pipelines.

    My Approach

    I solve problems from first principles. My process begins by identifying the fundamental challenge, analyzing its core tensions, and architecting a complete, optimized system to resolve them. I am a polyglot engineer who chooses the right tool for the jobâ€”from low-level C and Rust for data-intensive pipelines to high-level Python and TypeScript for AI and web services. I take an engineering approach to automation and am unafraid to optimize down to the bit level to achieve elegant, performant, and resilient systems.
                
After graduating, I found the entry-level market wasn't offering the kind of challenging work I was looking for. So, for the past two years, I've focused on building and deploying a series of production-grade systems to demonstrate and hone my skills in AI, high-performance web applications, and data engineering.
